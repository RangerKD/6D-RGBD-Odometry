## 6D-RGBD-Odometry

###brand_based_odometry

An rgb-d odometry algorihtm computing the 6DOF relative camera pose using BRAND features for frame-to-frame matching.

###brand_match

I attached the BRAND code as well as an example that shows how to use the class to create BRAND descriptors. To use this example you will need to install PCL library (www.pointclouds.org) and OpenCV (www.opencv.org). By the way, the BRAND code needs only OpenCV.
